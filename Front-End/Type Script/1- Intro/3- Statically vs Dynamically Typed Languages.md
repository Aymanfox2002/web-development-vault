### ðŸ”µ Statically Typed Languages

**Examples:** Rust, C, C++

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Variable Types**|Static â€” once a variable's type is declared, it **cannot be changed**.|
|**Type Checking**|Performed **at compile-time**, which means types are known before the code runs.|
|**Performance**|Usually **faster at runtime** because no type-checking happens during execution.|
|**Error Detection**|Errors (especially type-related ones) are **caught early during compilation**, reducing bugs at runtime.|

### ðŸŸ¢ Dynamically Typed Languages

**Examples:** PHP, Python, JavaScript

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Variable Types**|Dynamic â€” variable types can **change at any time** during execution.|
|**Type Checking**|Happens **at runtime**, meaning the interpreter checks types as the code runs.|
|**Performance**|**Slower at runtime** due to the need for ongoing type-checking.|
|**Error Detection**|Type errors may **only be found after the program is running**, which can lead to runtime crashes.|
