## 🌟 What is TypeScript?

**TypeScript** is a **superset of JavaScript** created by Microsoft. It adds **static typing** to JavaScript, which helps catch bugs early and improve developer productivity.

---
### ✅ TypeScript = JavaScript + Types

You can write regular JavaScript in TypeScript files, but you can also **add types** like this:

```ts
const name: string = "Ayman";
const age: number = 25;
const isActive: boolean = true;
```

---
## Install TypeScript

```powershell
npm i -g typescript
```


---

## 📁 TypeScript Files

- Use `.ts` for regular TypeScript
    
- Use `.tsx` when using **React with TypeScript**
    

---
## 🛠 Compilation

You write `.ts` files, and TypeScript compiles them into `.js` files using:

```bash
tsc filename.ts
```

---

## 💡 Good to Know

- TypeScript helps **during development**. After compilation, the output is **plain JavaScript**.
    
- You can incrementally add TypeScript to existing JavaScript projects.
