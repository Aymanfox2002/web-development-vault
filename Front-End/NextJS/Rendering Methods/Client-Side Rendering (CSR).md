## **What is it?**

**CSR** means the page is rendered in the browser using JavaScript after the initial HTML loads. The page is mostly empty at first, then React fetches and renders data dynamically.

---

## **How it works?**

- The browser loads a minimal HTML file.
- React takes over and fetches data via API calls.
- The content appears after JavaScript execution.
