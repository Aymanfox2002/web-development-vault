`Working Directory` and `Git Directory` are repositories (folders) for storing files. But they work in different ways. Here are the main distinctions between them.

## Creator of a Git vs. Working Directory

- A `working directory` is a folder you create to store all your project’s files.
- A `Git directory` is a folder Git creates in the working directory you instructed it to monitor.

## Visibility

- A `Git directory` is a hidden folder.
- A `working directory` is a regular folder.

## Usage of a Git vs. Working Directory

- A `Git directory` records the file versions you authorized Git to track.
- A `working repository` can store any file type. It can store files (or folders) that are under version control and those that are not.

## Location

- You can create a `working directory` anywhere in your system.
- Git creates the `Git directory` inside a working repository.

## Content of a Git vs. Working Directory

- A `working directory` contains both tracked and untracked files.
- A `Git directory` contains only tracked files.
