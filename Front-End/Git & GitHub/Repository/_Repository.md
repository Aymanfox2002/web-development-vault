## **Repository terminology**

Before getting started with repositories, learn these important terms.

| **Term**     | **Definition**                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Branch       | A parallel version of your code that is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch.                                 |
| Clone        | To download a full copy of a repository's data from GitHub.com, including all versions of every file and folder.                                         |
| Fork         | A new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository.                                                       |
| Merge        | To take the changes from one branch and apply them to another.                                                                                           |
| Pull request | A request to merge changes from one branch into another.                                                                                                 |
| Remote       | A repository stored on GitHub, not on your computer.                                                                                                     |
| Upstream     | The branch on an original repository that has been forked or cloned. The corresponding branch on the cloned or forked branch is called the "downstream." |
