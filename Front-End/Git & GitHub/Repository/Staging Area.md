In Git, a staging area serves as an intermediate step between your local repository changes and the actual commit.

- Temporary storage: The staging area holds changes that are intended to be part of the next commit.
- Previewing changes: It allows you to preview your changes before committing them.

> [!hint] 
>  Its technical name in Git parlance is the “**index**”, but the phrase “**staging area**” works just as well.
